I have been playing around with code since high school. While I've worked in many jobs with varying amounts of coding involved since then, coding has always been something I've sincerely enjoyed doing and learning. But for some reason, I have never really tried to fully pursue coding as a career. I've taught myself the bits I've needed to know to get the job done over the years, but usually haven't put in much more effort than that. I think part of me has always sort of assumed I would never make it as a web developer. I don't have a degree in Computer Science, so how can I ever be as good as those with formal education?

But that's just it. Some of the best developers don't have college degrees, and [more and more developers are self-taught](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education){:target="_blank"}. I'm not about to claim that I'm even remotely one of the best developers---there's a lot I don't know, and a lot I need to learn---but what's stopping me from trying?

Google ["learn web development"](https://www.google.com/?ion=1&espv=2#q=learn%20web%20development){:target="_blank"} and you'll see that there are almost 45 million results. There are so many resources to learn from, but almost every single one of them offers a different "right way" to learn, or a different list of "must-learn skills." For example, if you ask Stack Overflow which JavaScript framework you should use, you'll get dozens of replies, all recommending a different framework. So what's a girl to do?

As many self-taught developers will agree, most of us started by simply looking at other peoples' code. Of course, the best place to do that these days is Github. For more structured learning, there are tons of really great free resources, including the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science){:target="_blank"} program in Computer Science, [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/){:target="_blank"}. There may be better choices out there, but with so many to choose from, it's probably best to just pick one and start, so that's what I'm doing.

Fortunately, I'm not a complete newbie. I can currently comfortably build a site using a variety of modern technology, including Node, Angular, Bootstrap, and more, and I have, after all, technically been writing code for nearly 15 years. Unfortunately, that means I've probably picked up a lot of bad habits that I need to unlearn, and because I have not always kept on top of the field through my work, some of my skills are outdated. I'm not terrible, but I want to be better.

I have therefore made it my goal to work through all three of the above mentioned resources (OSS, The Odin Project, and Learn Python the Hard Way) in their entirety. I'll post about my progress as I go, along with thoughts about various web development topics. As I also aspire to one day be a [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad){:target="_blank"}, I'll eventually post about my travels.
